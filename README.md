# Portfolio-Site
Portfolio website that gives a description of each of my web dev projects. It features buttons and tabs. I created this site using HTML, CSS and Javascript.


### User Experience

The user navigates through descriptions of my projects by using using buttons and tabs.
The sidebar on the left contains buttons to select a project.
The display frame on the right displays information on the currently selected project. Each project is presented in the same layout template, with title, links, summary and tabs. The text description for each project is sub divided into 4 clickable tabs.
On larger screen sizes, the main content of the page matches the height of the browser window.


### Concepts

* The HTML document contains a template area for displaying information and a content storage area for storing information.
* Javascript modifies the webpage by inserting element nodes in the DOM and editing attributes in the DOM.
* Javascript indirectly influences the page's appearance by editing the style attributes on element nodes in order to change which elements are targeted by which CSS rule sets.
* The CSS transform property changes the rendered position of an HTML element (buttons).
* CSS transitions create smooth movement.
* Layout is controlled using CSS flexbox and grid.
* Icons are imported into the web page from an external repository (Font Awesome).
