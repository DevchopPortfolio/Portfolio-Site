                <article id="tab4" class="tabpage">
                    I made this project with HTML, CSS and PHP, without JavaScript.

                    <h4>PHP</h4>  
                    The Header section and Footer section are the same for every page so, to avoid repitition, are both located in separate files (header.php, footer.html) on the server. On the server the HTML from these files is imported to the main pages using PHP, specifically the 'include' statement.

                    The only page-specific change in the Header section is which nav bar button is currently highlighted. This is achieved by using PHP variables that control the id (value of HTML id attribute) of each button. These variables are applied to the HTML using the PHP 'echo' statement.
                    
                    <h4>Responsivity</h4>                    
                    To check the site's responsivity, view it at various window widths. Most sections of the site use media queries to achieve rearranged layouts at different widths.
                    
                    In the stylesheet, the styles are initially set for desktop screen. Media queries apply different values when the viewport width is less than 1100px (laptop), 800px (tablet) and 500px (mobile).
                                        
                    The header element is the container for the header. Default styles (wide viewport) set the 'display' property of the header element to 'flex'. This causes its content to be arranged in a single horizontal line. With narrower screens, its display property is 'block', which means the contents don't act as flex items, so they occupy separate rows, which takes up less horizontal space.
                    
                    The 'cards' section on the home page is a grid made of 4 items. Using media queries its template changes from 4 columns to 2 columns to 1 column, depending on screen width. A 3 column template is prevented, as this would look uneven in a 4-item-grid.
                    
                    On the contact page, the social media icons switch from a column along the left (wide screen) to a row along the top (narrow screen). This is done by changing the container's grid template from 2-columns with 1-row to 1-row with 2-columns.
                    
                    
                    <h4>Google Icons</h4>                    
                    Icons are imported to the site from the external repository: Google Icons (https://fonts.google.com/icons)
                    
                    Google icons are applied to the HTML doc using the following HTML syntax:
                    
                    in the HTML, the head element contains a link element with the following attributes:
                        href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" 
                        rel="stylesheet"
                    
                        Each element that marks-up a particular google icon must have the following attribute:
                        class="material-icons"
                        and the name of the particular google icon located in its content.                        
                    
                    
                    <h4>Sections</h4>                    
                    Each page is divided vertically into sections. All markup is located inside these sections. Each page has a header section, footer section, and other sections in between. In the HTML, every section is surrounded by its own outer wrapper element and inner wrapper element. 
                    
                    <b>Outer wrappers</b>
                        Outer wrappers are one of the following: 
                            - a header element for the header section
                            - a footer element for the footer section
                            - a section element for all other sections
                    
                    <b>Inner wrappers</b>
                        Every section has an inner wrapper element. All inner wrappers are div elements with the class attribute of "wrapper". Styles that are consistent for all sections in the site target the inner wrapper via its "wrapper" class. This allows all sections on the site to have the following style rules:
                            - a width that is 80% the width of the window.
                            - a left/right margin used to horizontally centre the content.
                    
                    
                    <h4>CSS variables </h4>                    
                    For some CSS properties, the same values are used repeatedly throughout the stylesheet. In these cases, CSS variables (CSS custom properties) are used to store and apply values. All CSS variables are declared and populated at the top of the stylesheet using the :root selector. CSS variables are used in this website for storing colours.
                    
                    
                    <h4>CSS document</h4>                    
                    The CSS stylesheet is divided into the following sections:
                    
                    <b>Globally inherited properties</b>
                        root

            <h2 class="title">Calendar</h2>            

            <p class="summary">An app I made in HTML, CSS and javascript that procedurally generates a 1 year calendar.
                The user can input settings and type notes into each day.     
            </p>
        
            <div class="tabpages">

                <article id="tab1" class="tabpage">	
                First the user can make some selections in the options page:
                    - on which day of the week the calendar's year starts (1st Jan)
                    - whether or not it's a leap year
                    - favourite day of the year
                 
                Then the calendar is procedurally generated and the browser navigates to it. The calendar is a grid that fills the browser window. Weekdays are columns and months are rows. 
                
                Each day of the calendar is a grid 'cell' that has: 
                    - a number indicating the date
                    - space for user's notes
                    - a colour determined by to its month
                
                The user can click on any day cell and type notes into that day. If they enter more text than is able to fit, a vertical scroll bar appears on the cell.
                
                Details of the currently selected day are given in the info bar at the bottom of the window.

                The 'favourite day' cell is automatically labelled.

                    An app that solves a problem by using an algorithm.
                    Javscript interacts with the DOM to procedurally build an HTML document and create a web page.
                    HTML forms (text input, selection menu, date selector) take user input.
                    HTML attributes pass user input data from the HTML form to javascript.
                    The javascript sessionStorage Class transfers data between webpages.
                    Javascript reads the values of CSS custom properties.
                    A 'for loop' creates a series of JS objects.
                    A function call located inside a loop to invoke a function multiple times, passing different arguments each time.
                    Javascript's DOM utilities copy, modify and insert elements to the web page.
                    Data attributes store meta data in HTML elements.
                    An event listener detects the user's mouse clicks.
                    Keyboard focus is detected and controlled.
                    Page layout is controlled by CSS box model, flexbox and grid.

                    <h4>The Javascript algorithm</h4> 
                    At first the year consists of only 1 day and 1 month which exiss as an HTML elements. At runtime javascript creates copies of these elements to build the calendar.
                    
                    The day element is a div called #celltemplate. The month element is a div called #monthtemplate.                     
                    A loop cycles through the months. That loop contains another loop that cycles through the days of that month. In each loop cycle, the 'createcell' function is called to make a copy of #celltemplate. This process creates all the days of the calendar as HTML elements.                     
                    In the 'createcell' function, each day cell is given:
                        • various data attributes (custom attributes) that store metadata (date, month, weekday, daycode) about that day
                        • a 'click' event listener, for triggering the text input form (see below)                          
                    
                    <h4>Behaviour of the text input form</h4>                         
                        The text input form is controlled by the 'formworker' function.
                        When the user clicks a day cell, the cell temporarily becomes the parent element of the HTML text input form, which exists in the HTML as the form element and textarea element. This is done using the DOM utility: appendChild()
                        Any text already in the day cell is copied into the form. The user can then use the form to edit the text in the day cell. 
                        When the user clicks elsewhere, the text input form loses keyboard focus, which triggers an event listener, which calls an event-handler function. The function 
                            - removes the form (using DOM utility: remove) from the day cell
                            - copies the form's text (using the text input's 'value' property) 
                            - pastes the text to the day cell using the cell's innerHTML property                     
                     
                    <h4>Column headings</h4>                     
                    The upper grid displays column headings containing the names of the days of the week
                     
                    CSS sets the uppergrid as position: fixed, so the grid stays at the top of the browser viewport regardless of vertical scrolling.
                     
                    A header element contains seven h2 elements which contain the week day names. The header is a CSS grid so that the weekday names are in columns that line up precisely with the grid columns of the lower grid.                     
                      
                    <h4>Left sidebar</h4>                     
                    The left sidebar of the lower grid is a single column that displays each month name inside a box. A javascript algorithm is used to determine the height of each month box in the sidebar, which depends on the number of weeks that each particular month spans.
                     
                    <b>The sidebar algorithm</b>
                        An array called months contains an array item for each month
                        Each array item contains an object which contains data on that month including each month's 'start week'. A 'for loop' uses this data to calculate the months 'span' value (how many weeks that month covers). From this the month's height (row height) in rem units is calculated.
                        This height value is transferred from javascript to the element's inline CSS using the style.setProperty() function                            
                        
                    <h4>Metadata</h4>   
                        Each day exists as a separate HTML element. 
                        Each of these elements contains metadata about that day, which is stored in that element's data attributes.                         
                        This metadata describes the day's date, weekday name (e.g, Monday), month name (e.g, January), week number, and day number (ranging from 0 to 365).                         
                        When the user clicks a day cell, that day's meta data is displayed in the Info Bar at the bottom of the window.
                        The user's click calls the cell's event listener function which uses the getAttribute() method to get the day's meta data and transfer it to the Info Bar as text.

                    hPlusSport is a fictitious company created by LinkedIn Corporation for the creation and development of educational training materials. It includes a website (https://hplussport.com/) and an API.

                    Using HTML, CSS and Javascript I created a webpage that acts as a simple REST client. 
                    
                    When the catalogue page is opened in the browser, it creates and sends a REST request to the hPlusSport API. The type of request is XMLHttpRequest (XHR). The request targets a resource which is a JSON file that gives details (name, description, image, price) of a range of fictional products. The API responds by sending the file. The client reads and renders the data to the webpage so that the user can browse through the products.
                    
                    (To demonstrate the content of the JSON file, here is <a href="https://sub.devchop.co.uk/raw/raw.html" target="_blank" style="color:lightpink"> another web page <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span></a> I created which gets the same resource from the same API, but presents the raw data in a simpler layout, using less style formatting.)
                    
                    
                    <h4>Details of the request and response</h4>                        
                    <b>Create an XHR object</b>
                    The XMLHttpRequest Class is instantiated to create an object called 'myrequest'. The properties and methods of this object will handle the request and response.                    
                    
                    <b>Specify a request</b>
                    The object's open() method is used to specify the request. Secifically, it gives:
                        - the URL of the resource, which is https://hplussport.com/api/products 
                        - and the type of verb, which is GET.
                    GET will instruct the API to respond by sending the targeted resource.                    
                    
                    <b>Send the request</b>
                    The send() method sends the request and starts the request-response transaction.                    
                    
                    <b>Handle the response</b>
                    The response triggers the object's 'onload' event property, which invokes its event-handler-function. The response also includes the resource which is a JSON file that populates the 'myrequest.response' property.                    
                    
                    <b>Process the data</b>
                    Inside the event-handler-function, the 'JSON.parse()' method parses the JSON string into a an array (the products array). Each array item contains an object that represents one product. Each object contains the following key names:
                        id
                        name
                        description
                        price
                        image_title
                        image                    
                    
                    <b>Generate cards</b>
                    To display the information on the page, the products will be presented in a gallery of HTML elements, called cards. Each card contains the name and image of 1 product.
                    
                    How the HTML cards are made:
                    
                    Only 1 card is described in the HTML document, which has the ID of 'cardtemplate'. This is used as a template for all other cards. It is not rendered as it has the CSS property of 'display: none'.
                    
                    A forEach() method iterates through each item of the products array, and performs the following operations on each product:
                        - the cloneNode() method makes a copy of the HTML card template element.
                        - the new card's child elements are populated with the product title and product image.
                        - the new card is given an event listener that will trigger when the user clicks the card, and will call the 'populatefocusframe' function, which puts the card's product details in the left frame.
                        - the new card is added to the gallery by attaching it to the gallery container element (#lowerframe).

                    The HTML document contains a template area for displaying information and a content storage area for storing information.
                    Javascript modifies the webpage by inserting element nodes in the DOM and editing attributes in the DOM.
                    Javascript indirectly influences the page's appearance by editing the style attributes on element nodes in order to change which elements are targeted by which CSS rule sets.
                    The CSS transform property changes the rendered position of an HTML element (buttons).
                    CSS transitions create smooth movement.
                    Layout is controlled using CSS flexbox and grid.
                    Icons are imported into the web page from an external repository (Font Awesome).

                    <h4>Buttons and Tabs</h4>
                    The page has clickable buttons and clickable tabs. They change what is displayed on the page by causing javascript to edit the DOM. They each achieve this in a different way
                        - the buttons work by causing DOM elements to be copied and inserted
                        - the tabs work by causing attributes on DOM elements to be edited                    
                    
                    <h4>Buttons</h4>                    
                    There are multiple 'posts'. Each post contains the data (title, links, summary, tabpages) for a different project.
                    
                    The user clicks a button in the left menu to select which post to view in the template on the right. Javascript then copies that post's data from the content library to the display template, replacing whatever content the template currently contained.
                    
                    Only the content of the currently active post is applied to the template at one time. This process is an example of the separation of template from content.
                    
                    The template presents posts in a standardised way, controlling their presentation/layout. The template is composed of various HTML elements and is located in the 'div #rightframe' element.
                    
                    Posts are located in HTML document, in the 'content library' which is the 'div #contentlibrary' element. The content library appears in the HTML but it is omitted from the page, due to the following CSS rule set:
                        #contentlibrary {
                            display: none
                        }
                    Therefore, a post is only visible after javascript has copied its data from the content library to the template.
                    
                    <b>DOM utilities</b>
                    Each button has a data attribute called data-target. Its value indicates which post the button targets.
                    Javascript gets this string value using the getAttribute() method, and uses it in a querySelector to target the correct post element.
                    The cloneNode() method is then used to make copies of the various HTML elements in the post.
                    The appendChild() method is then used to append these copies to various parts of the template.                    
                    
                    <h4>Tabs</h4>                    
                    In the HTML document are 4 clickable tabs. Each has a corresponding tabpage element that contains text. The tabpage elements are located in the #tabpageholder element and belong to the tabpage class (i.e, have a value of 'tabpage' in their class attribute)
                    
                    The tabpage elements are invisible, due to the following CSS ruleset:
                    
                    .tabpage {
                        display: none;
                    }
                    
                    1 of the 4 tabpages may be the 'active' tabpage as it has the 'active' class in its class attribute. This tabpage is visible because it is targeted by the following CSS ruleset:
                    
                    .tabpage.active {
                        display: block;
                    }
                    
                    When the user clicks a tab, Javascript moves the 'active' class to its corresponding tabpage. This is achieved by the following:
                    
                    The user's click triggers the tab's 'click' eventListener, which calls a callback function (called 'tabclicked') which removes the 'active' class name from all tabpages, then adds the 'active' class name only to the clicked tab's target tabpage.
                    
                    Javascript reads/edits an element's classes by using the element's classList property:
                        element.classList.remove(classname)
                        element.classList.add(classname)
                    
                    <b>Controlling which tabpage is targeted by which tab</b>
                    Each tab element contains a data attribute called 'data-target'. Its value is a string that specifies the ID (value of the element's ID attribute) of its target tabpage element. This value is aquired using the tab element's getAttribute() method and is used to target the correct tabpage by including it in a querySelector() method.                    

                    <h4>Icons from font awesome</h4>                    
                    To give the page access to Font Awesome icons, a link element is included in the HTML document's head section, with the following attributes:
                        link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"
                    
                    Then an icon can be inserted in an HTML element by giving the element the following class name:
                        fa fa-nameoficon

                    An alternative version of an existing website, using the same content but a different layout and style.
                    Kadence Theme's customizer specifies content and style of generic features.

                    Gutenberg's 'media embed blocks' embed streaming media into posts.
                    Posts belong to specific categories, so that different posts appear in different archive pages.
                    WordPress plugins provide extra features to the page builder (a visitor's form and twitter feed).

                <article id="tab4" class="tabpage">                        
                    While studying Wordpress, I happened to visit the official site of author/historian Mark Lewisohn: <a href="https://www.marklewisohn.net" target="_blank" style="color:lightpink">www.marklewisohn.net <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span> </a>
                    I decided to try to use WordPress to make my own version of that site. My demo site copies all the content and features from the original site, but with different styles and page layouts.                    
                    <!-- <h4>Text and Images</h4> 
                    I directly copied the basic content (text and images).
                    I used a free online background transparency converter (https://onlinepngtools.com/create-transparent-png) to make the backgrounds of these images transparent so that they could be visually integrated better into the site. -->                    
                    <h4>Gutenberg</h4> 
                    I used the default WordPress block editor (Gutenberg) as the page builder. I made use of many of Gutenberg's block types, including various blocks to control layout (group, columns, column, cover, spacer) and add content (image, heading, paragraph, button, quote, pullquote).                    
                    I used 'column' blocks to layout multiple columns in a single row. On the front page, I used the the 'cover' block to put a stationary background image behind a scrolling foreground.
                    
                    <h4>Posts</h4> 
                    The demo site contains embedded audio and video streaming media. Each piece of streaming media exists as a post that can be viewed as a webpage. Each post has a title, date, category, featured image and content.
                    There are 2 categories of post: audio and video. Each post belongs to one of these categories. WordPress automatically generates the following 'archive pages', which contain lists of specific posts:
                        - all posts
                        - posts of the media category 
                        - posts of the audio category
                    These archive pages are found under 'Media' in the site's navigation menu. The Kadence Theme contains settings that let me control the appearance/layout for these archive pages.
                    
                    <h4>Embedding streaming media</h4> 
                    Gutenberg has various block types that allow media from other websites to be embedded. It has specific blocks for the most popular media websites, including a Youtube embed block, SoundCloud embed block, Vimeo embed block. 
                    For other streaming websites Gutenberg has a generic 'embed' block. The URL of the embed media can be pasted into the embed block's URL field. Gutenberg also has a custom HTML block. Into this I pasted an iframe HTML element. This was required for embedding media from BBC iPlayer and Podbean. Wherever it was not possible to make an embed of the streaming media, I just provided an external link.
                    
                    <h4>Twitter Feed</h4> 
                    To embed Mark Lewisohn's twitter feed into the home page, installed a plugin called 'Custom Twitter Feeds', which adds a block to gutenberg page editor called 'Twitter Feed'. The URL of the target Twitter feed can be pasted into the block's URL field.
                    
                    <h4>Visitor's Form</h4> 
                    To add a form that visitors can submit I installed a plugin called 'Kadence Blocks'. It provides various extra blocks to gutenberg, including a form block, with a field for name, email and message. 
                    I tested whether this form could send its inputted data as an automated email to the site administrator when a visitor submits it. To allow the autogenerated emails to reach the recipient without being blocked, I had to install a plugin called 'WP Mail SMTP'.
                    However, since this is a demo site, I disabled this feature, so that the form can't be submitted.
                    
                    <h4>Migration using WPvivid plugin</h4> 
                    Initially, instead of installing WordPress to my online hosted account, I installed it locally to my PC, using 'Bitnami WP stack'. I developed the demo website on this local WordPress installation.
                    Later, I installed a blank copy of WordPress to my online hosted account and did a website migration onto it, in which I migrated my entire demo website onto my hosting account using a WordPress plugin called 'WPvivid Backup' by WPvivid Team. This requires the plugin to be installed on both WordPress installations.
